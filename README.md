Overview of the project
Project:SIMPLE CALUCLATOR

Objective
The objective of this project to perform Basic arithemetic operations, such as addition,subtraction,multiplication,division.it should accept numerical input from the user
process these inputs according to choosen operation,display result.This type of caluclator is designed to be user-friendly and efficient for everyday caluclations.

Key Activities

1.Define functions:Create functions for each arithemetic operation
2.User Input: Develop a mechanism to get user input for numbers and desired operation
3.Perform Caluclations:Based on user's choice of operation,use corresponding number to perform caluclation
4.Handle Errors:Implement error handling for invalid inputs and division by user
5.Display Results:Output The result  of the caluclation to the user

Technologies used

1.Python:The primary programming language used for writing code for simple caluclator program, it is simple and readable.
2.Functions:To encapsulate arithemetic operations
